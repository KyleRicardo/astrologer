## Origin

Since my blog went offline around 2020, it has been neglected for a long time. Occasionally, I had ideas to rebuild and relaunch it, but they never came to fruition. The reasons were two-fold: first, I didn't have much I wanted to write about, and second, I couldn't find a blog framework and theme that I truly loved.

Before going offline, my blog was built with Hexo using the famous NexT theme. Back in 2018, that was the mainstream choice, and at the time, I thought the NexT theme looked pretty good—at least compared to the themes provided on the Hexo official website.

During its downtime, I explored Hugo, but it didn't feel significantly different, and the themes were mediocre, so I lacked motivation.

Later, with the boom of frontend frameworks, I looked into others like Gatsby, Nuxt, and Nextra. I always felt the frameworks themselves were somewhat incomplete and didn't want to spend too much effort, so I kept stalling.

Recently, after finishing a certain exam and feeling relaxed, I happened to see some influential developers on Twitter migrating their sites to Astro. I didn't know much about it, but seeing them move made me realize this framework must be exceptional.

To be honest, when I first heard about this framework a year ago, I glanced at the official website and didn't feel much. It provided several blog themes, but they felt skeletal and weren't for me. Also, my frontend skills were quite basic at the time, and I didn't have the stomach for full customization.

However, a year later, I've grown quite a bit. My proficiency with Tailwind CSS has increased significantly, and influenced by Shadcn, my aesthetic sense has also improved. Since I had some free time recently, the idea emerged: why not use Astro combined with Tailwind CSS, inspired by the Shadcn aesthetic, to write a blog theme from scratch?

## Design and Development

No sooner said than done. On the day I finished my exam, I created the folder and repo. I realized that jumping straight into code might lead to wasted effort and lacked intuition. Coincidentally, I had just retaken a Figma course—it felt like my recent experiences were all leading me toward this project. I first designed several major pages in Figma, even creating simple prototype animations. Though some details needed adjustment, I felt ready to start coding.

I originally planned to use Cursor for assistance, but after trying it, I felt I was better off writing it myself. After defining the MVP scope, I worked feverishly every evening and weekend, feeling fully motivated. It took about half a month for the MVP to approach completion.

During the process, new ideas kept popping up. I added them to the backlog but soon realized that if I kept adding features, the MVP would never be finished. I analyzed the requirements carefully, established milestones, and stopped adding new features to the MVP milestone.

Originally, I intended to use pure Astro and Tailwind to implement all components manually. Eventually, for convenience, I introduced Shadcn, which inevitably brought in React. However, the components used so far are minimal. I might rewrite them in Astro later to completely remove the React dependency.

Some more creative ideas are slowly being added to the backlog for future iterative delivery. For now, I'm focusing on delivering the most valuable features first, re-evaluating the concept of **Agile** in the process.

## Thoughts

During development, I found the source code for my old archived blog in a corner of my hard drive. After several failed attempts to run it, I finally saw it again and realized the NexT theme was no longer just "outdated" to me—it was painfully unattractive. It's fascinating how time and tastes change.

I'm quite satisfied with this theme. I admit I've drawn inspiration from many great developers' blog themes and designs from famous company websites. The final result is a hybrid that reflects my own aesthetic style.

My initial purpose for writing this theme was personal use, but I want to share it through open source. If someone else happens to like this theme and decides to use it for their own blog, I would be deeply honored.

One person's strength is limited; that's why we need a community. If anyone can provide feedback, suggestions, or even contribute code during use, that would be wonderful.
